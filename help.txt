DAILY VIEW
__________

1) The daily view displays the tasks that have been scheduled for a particular
   day.
2) You can add/edit/delete tasks for that particular day by using the keyboard
   shortcuts available at the bottom of the screen.
3) You can also change the status of tasks, such as "Completed", "Pending",
   "Cancelled".  By default, when a new task is added, its status is set to
   "Pending".  Once you have finished performing the task, you can mark it as
   "Completed".  If, for some reason, you decide not to perform that task any
   longer, you can simply mark it as "Cancelled".
4) In addition to the tasks set specifically for this day, any "recurrent"
   tasks that have been set, and which apply for this day, are also shown in
   the daily view.  For more information on recurrent tasks, refer the section
   on Recurrent Tasks below.
5) You can navigate to the next day and previous day by using the keyboard 
   shortcuts available at the bottom of the screen.
6) You can also navigate to the Weekly View, Monthly View or the Recurrent 
   Tasks by using the shortcuts available.

WEEKLY VIEW
___________

1) The weekly view displays the number of tasks, and a brief description of 
   the tasks that have been set for the days in that particular week.
2) Saturday and Sunday are assumed to be "holidays" by default.  You can also
   mark other days as holidays, or unmark a holiday, by using the shortcuts
   available.  The holidays and working days are shown with different colors
   for easier reference.
3) You can navigate to the next week or the previous week by using the
   keyboard shortcuts available at the bottom of the screen.
4) One day is always shown as highlighted with a yellow background in the
   weekly view, and you can easily go directly to that day's daily view, by
   simply pressing ENTER when that day is selected.
5) You can also navigate to the daily view, monthly view or recurrent tasks
   view by using the available shortcuts.

MONTHLY VIEW
____________

1) The monthly view displays the days of the selected month, in a calender
   style view.
2) You can easily navigate around the different days of the month by using the
   arrow keys, or the 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' vi style shortcuts. 
3) At any time, one day is selected in the month with a hightlighted
   background, and you can easily navigate to that day by pressing ENTER.
4) The Weekly view for the selected day can be switched to by using the 
   shortcut available at the bottom of the screen.
5) You can also move to the next or previous monthly view by using the
   available shortcuts.
6) The default view when Newton begins is the Monthly view, and the day that
   is selected by default is Today.  This helps you locate what tasks you had
   set up for today, and for upcoming days.

RECURRENT TASKS
_______________

1) Recurrent tasks are those tasks that have an associated "rule" which maps
   these tasks to multiple days.
2) Recurrent tasks can be set with daily schedule, in which you can specify
   whether you want the task to be set for all days, for only holidays, or
   for only working days.
3) You can also set a weekly schedule, in which one or a combination of more
   than one days of the week can be chosen for this task.  For example, you
   can set a task that need to be done every Sunday and Tuesday.
4) Monthly schedules can also be set up.  For example, you can set a recurrent
   task to be done on the 2nd and 4th of every month.
5) The last kind of schedule is yearly, in which on particular dates of every
   year, a task can be scheduled (e.g., on 4th September of every year).

PRINTING TASKS TO PDF
---------------------
Starting with Newton 0.2, you can choose to print your tasks that are recorded
in the database to a PDF document using the command line.

Usage: newton 
  -o <filename.pdf>     specify output file name (must end if .pdf)
                        this is the output file to which the task list will be
written
  -f <date>             specify start date (dd/mm/yyyy or today or tomorrow)
                        this is the start date from which to enumerate tasks
  -t <date>             specify end date (dd/mm/yyyy or today or tomorrow)
                        this is the end date until which to enumerate tasks
  -d <no. of days>      specify number of days
                        this is the number of days for which to enumerate
tasks
  -w                    specify whole week following the start date
                        if you specify this, the from date is taken as
beginning of week
  --today               print task list for today
  --tomorrow            print task list for tomorrow
  --help                print this usage

  Examples:
  To print tasks from 12/09/2005 to 03/01/2006 to ./output.pdf, do:
        newton -o ./output.pdf -f 12/09/2005 -t 03/01/2006

  To print tasks for 12 days starting 12/09/2005 to ./output.pdf, do:
        newton -o ./output.pdf -f 12/09/2005 -d 12

        To print tasks for the week starting 12/09/2005 to ./output.pdf, do:
        newton -o ./output.pdf -f 12/09/2005 -w

  To print tasks for today to ./output.pdf, do:
        newton -o ./output.pdf --today

  To print tasks for 8 days starting from tomorrow to ./output.pdf, do:
        newton -o ./output.pdf -f tomorrow -d 8

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
__________________________

Q) I'm not able to run Newton on my system.  When I run it, it
   doesn't display anything on the screen!
A) Probably your system does not support the screen based displays.
   Newton requires screen based display support.  This is present
   in most modern X-window based unix systems.

Q) I have observed a crash in the program.  What do I do?
A) That is not surprising, since I have written this in such a hurry.
   If you can give me the exact situation in which you observed the
   fault, please do write to me with the details, and I will try to provide 
   a fix asap.

Q) I have a few suggestions for improvement of Newton.
A) Please mail me those valuable suggestions at the contact information
   given on the homepage of Newton, and I will try to analyze them.  Thanks.
